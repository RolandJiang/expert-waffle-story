Once upon a time there was a waffle named Ryan. Ryan was born in Wafflandia. Ryan had big dreams.
He wanted to attend the elitest waffle school. Unfortunately, he was born into a family without a lot of money.
This made it difficult for him to afford the high enrollment costs. However, Ryan refused to be deterred.
While he was browsing the internet, he came up with a genius idea. There was a chance it would fail, but he knew he had to give it a shot.
