Once upon a time there was a waffle named Ryan. Ryan was born in Wafflandia. Ryan had big dreams.
He wanted to attend the elitest waffle school. Unfortunately, he was born into a family without a lot of money.
This made it difficult for him to afford the high enrollment costs. However, Ryan refused to be deterred.
While he was browsing the internet, he came up with a genius idea. There was a chance it would fail, but he knew he had to give it a shot.

Ryan landed upon the miraculous free website called Khan Academy. Sal Khan's videos captivated Ryan the waffle, and he began binge
watching every video that existed on the website. He worked through dozens of videos from  Calculus, Linear Algebra, to SAT prep. His grades 
were through the roof. Ryan believed his excellent scores would draw the attention of elitist waffle schools across the nation. He also 
believed his poor household would draw mercy from the FAFSA, or elitist waffle schools would gift Ryan with scholarships. Ryan was optimistic.
